                                                  METHODS
Method is a set of statements that are used to perform an operation
Method is same as Functions in C language
Method increases the readability of the code and makes the code simple

Example :
public class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {  //It is main method
        AreaOfRectangle(10,20);

    }
    public static void AreaOfRectangle(int length,int breadth){ //It is a method
        int result = 2*(length+breadth);
        System.out.println(result);
    }
//Return data type is void.So it returns nothing
}
